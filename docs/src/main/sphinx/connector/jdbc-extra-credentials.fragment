In some cases, users may want to hide the credentials from the configuration file for security considerations. They can use ``user-credential-name`` and ``password-credential-name`` to specify the credential keys instead of the actual credentials. Then when querying, the connector can get the actual credentials from the connection string or command-line arguments with the keys:


.. code-block:: none

    user-credential-name=extra-credential-name
    password-credential-name=extra-credential-password

Users can pass the extra credentials via ``--extra-credential`` with :doc:`/installation/cli` and ``extraCredentials`` with :doc:`/installation/jdbc`.
